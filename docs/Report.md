# Canada_Energy_Project
CS2545 Term Project, Based on Canada Energy Data

## Objective
The Energy Data theme has been selected for this project. The objective is to analyze renewable energy usage in Canada and compare it with fossil fuel-based power generation. As global efforts focus on sustainability, Canada has experienced a shift towards green energy production. This analysis will examine the growth and distribution of renewable energy across different provinces over the past 30 years, exploring how geography, climate, and policy decisions have influenced and continue to determine energy production and consumption habits.

## Introduction
As Canada transitions toward a more sustainable energy future, understanding regional patterns in electricity generation and consumption has become increasingly important. This project explores the distribution of renewable and fossil fuel-based power across provinces, evaluating how geography, infrastructure, and policy influence energy outcomes. 

The analysis addresses two major challenges: significant regional disparities in energy sources and the absence of a unified national energy strategy. Using data from 2005 to 2050—including historical and projected values—this study examines electricity generation, sectoral demand, pricing differences, and import/export trends at both provincial and national levels. 

Public datasets from Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), Statistics Canada, and the Canadian Energy Regulator (CER) were analyzed using Python tools in Jupyter Notebooks. Key metrics include per capita energy use, generation efficiency, and trade balances. Data were normalized to enable meaningful cross-provincial comparisons, and visualizations were used to highlight trends and disparities. 

This project ultimately aims to identify where energy systems are efficient, where improvements are needed, and how better integration across provinces could benefit Canada’s energy landscape.

## Related Work (if applicable)
This project draws heavily on data and projections published by the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) and Statistics Canada, which serve as foundational resources for energy analysis in Canada. The Canada’s Energy Future 2023 report by CER provided long-term projections on electricity generation, capacity, demand, and emissions through to 2050. It informed the selection of analytical dimensions and helped guide scenario comparisons involving net-zero emission targets and projected shifts in generation technology​.
