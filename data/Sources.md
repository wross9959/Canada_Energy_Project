# All Dataset Sources


### Exports and Imports of Electricity Summary
National Total levels 

- https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/CommodityStatistics/Statistics.aspx?language=english

Use this to identify net surplus or deficit trends

### Exports Summary Report by Source, Authorization and Exchange Type
Who Exports energy and by what method 
- https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/CommodityStatistics/Statistics.aspx?language=english
You may see which provinces are exporters (if source province is shown)

###  Import Summary Report by Destination
Same as above but for imports
- https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/CommodityStatistics/Statistics.aspx?language=english
Helpful if some provinces import electricity — which supports your "decentralized system" argument

###  Export Sales Summary by Destination and Source
Check if it has province level data
 Lets you track which provinces are selling to the U.S. or other provinces


### Import Purchases Summary by Source and Destination
Shows where imports are coming from — possibly U.S. → Canada
Could help you estimate reliance on U.S. power in certain provinces



### Electricity Generation by Source
